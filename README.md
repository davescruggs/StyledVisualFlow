Mobile Styling for Visual Flow

This is a project to convert the Table-styled Salesforce Visual Flow into a Responsive, Mobile-Ready Visualforce layout.

I'm using jQuery to convert the table to a list, and Bootstrap to style the page, in addition to some extensible styling available through the Visual Flow documentation.

There is also an option that uses a table style--not as responsive, but no transformation.

I'm using the Lead Creation Flow from the sample visualflows pack on the AppExchange.

I haven't added the copyright source files. I have added a license file. The project will eventually be in line with other Developerforce projects--treat those as your copyright and license terms.

This project is without any warranty whatsoever, expressed or implied. It has not been through a complete production-quality set of testing suites.

Some of the more interesting aspects happen in the JavaScript and CSS files. You can see them expanded under the Resource Bundles folder.
