Mobile Styling for Visual Flow

This is a project to convert the Table-styled Salesforce Visual Flow into a Responsive, Mobile-Ready Visualforce layout.

I'm using jQuery to convert the table to a list, and Bootstrap to style the page, in addition to some extensible styling available through the Visual Flow documentation.

I haven't added the copyright or license to the project yet. They will be added in line with other Developerforce projects.

This project is without any warranty whatsoever, expressed or implied. It has not been through a complete production-quality set of testing suites.
